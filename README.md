This is a jupyter notebook to learn how to use simple machine learning algorithms, here applied on MNIST data from keras

Just git clone the repository and start playing :

```
git clone https://github.com/vicbonj/cours_ml.git
cd cours_ml/
jupyter-notebook cours_ml.ipynb
```

You need to have installed scikit-learn, keras, tensorflow and/or tensorflow-gpu if you have a GPU (it will be faster for the CNN algorithm), better with python3.6 version.

Implemented so far:
- ANN model
- CNN model

To come:
- Comparison with Random Forest
